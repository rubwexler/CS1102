<p>This course is an introduction to computer programming. Programming is the art of explaining to a
computer what you want it to do, in exact detail and in a language that the computer can understand.
Programming is only one part of computer science, but it is the most basic and most central part. It is
an activity that requires you to think logically, to solve problems, to express yourself clearly, and often
to endure a certain amount of frustration as you try to get your programs to work. The result, though,
can be very rewarding. Many different languages are used for writing computer programs. Fortunately,
it is possible to learn the principles and general techniques of programming that can be applied no
matter what language you write in. Although you will work with a specific language, you should try not
to lose sight of the general ideas. In this course, we will use the Java programming language. Java is a
relatively new language, having been introduced in 1995. In the years since its introduction, it has
become one of the most important languages for real application development. It is a very versatile
language. Java can be used to write regular desktop applications and to make "applets" that can appear
on Web pages. Many complex interactive Web sites are written in Java, and it can be used to write
applications for many types of mobile phones. Even high-performance scientific programming has
been done in Java.</p>

chapter, great for drilling essential concepts!
- Mosh Hamedani's Java videos: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIrMbAQSU34 .
- Get familiar with using the terminal. Team Treehouse has an "Introduction to the Terminal" course. They offer a free 7 day trial: https://teamtreehouse.com/library/introduction-to-the-terminal and there is this free resource to help you get started: https://github.com/rubwexler/linux
